* 3d Printer
So my 3d printer is a [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D218NX3/][Creality Ender 3]].
It's set up to use my raspberry pi and octopi to let me control it remotely
and a raspberry pi cam to moniter the prints and take neat timelapses.

As I do more experiments I will post the setup and results here.
* Openscad

** ob-scad
 The library ob-scad allows for the use of openscad blocks.
 These blocks allow for you to program objects to be rendered by the OpenSCAD program
 and can be later turned into 3d printed objects.
 Results of the scad blocks can be images, and at a later point I will experiment with gifs.
